README for Ansible directory
============================

== Roles
There are two types of Ansible roles:

* main-xxxx are top-level roles and correspond to roles in puppet terminology
* other roles implement one component and correspond to "profiles" in puppet 
  terminology

== Tags
Ansible roles will use the following tags:

* *installation* for tasks which must be executed when installing software
  during the creation of the AMI at a time details about the server are not
  known
* *configuration* for tasks which must be executed to apply the configuration
  during the bootstrap stage at the creation of the EC2 instance in an
  Auto-Scaling-Group or at a later stage when the configuration needs to be
  modified
