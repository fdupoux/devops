README for Jenkins directory
============================

This directory contains Jenkins DSL code which allows to create and maintain
all Jenkins Jobs configuration as Groovy code using the
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Job+DSL+Plugin[Jenkins DSL plugin]

The ansible.groovy script will create all Jenkins jobs defined in arrays. These
arrays provide jobs attributes. These arrays are defined in account specific
groovy files located in the same directory as the main ansible.groovy script. It
allows to maintain separate jobs definitions for separate AWS accounts which all
have Jenkins jobs following the same definition scheme. Here is an example with
three AWS Accounts:

* testacnt.groovy
* client01.groovy
* client02.groovy

Then the sensitive AWS Access keys for each AWS accounts will be located in
the following files: "${profilespath}/aws-account-${account}.properties". These
files will be loaded by Jenkins at the time of the execution and Ansible will
use these environment variables.
